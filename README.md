## A Message to the September 2022 Hackathon Organisers & Hosts
To begin we would like to thank our event organisers and hosts - [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), [Trust in SODA](https://www.trustinsoda.com/) and [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.ie/).

There is a great deal of time and knowhow that goes into a event like this.  We look forward to working with others, do some networking and learn more more from industry leaders.

## Our Team
Our team called  consisted of 5 members who have never met.  They are:

- Andruis S (Enthusiast)
- Fran (Enthusiast)
- StevenW (Newbie)
- John de Lara (Newbie)
- Eoghan Behan (Newbie)

We are inexperienced so choose to develop static website.
By limiting technologies used to HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, project development was accessible to all members as we shared in these compentancies.
Further considerations were:
- the option for more experienced team members to use Bootstrap5 framework without compromising other using vanilla HTML/CSS
- limited development time before presentation
- simplier deployment through GitHub Pages.
